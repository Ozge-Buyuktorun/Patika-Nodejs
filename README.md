## 📚 Node.js Projects — Patika.dev Assignments & Experiments

Welcome to my Node.js repository!
This project includes my homework assignments from Patika.dev as well as my personal experiments with Node.js modules and frameworks.

## 📂 Project Structure
1. circle-area.js
➡️ A simple module to calculate the area and volume of a circle based on the given radius.
2. post-sort.js
➡️ An example project using the HTTP module to sort and display posts.
3. Koa Framework Example
➡️ A basic setup demonstrating the use of the Koa web framework for building a simple server.
node_modules/
➡️ Contains all installed project dependencies (auto-generated by npm).
package.json & package-lock.json
➡️ Project metadata and dependency management files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:
```
//Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

//Install dependencies:
npm install

//Run the specific files using Node.js:
node circle-area.js
node post-sort.js

//For Koa server:
node app.js
```

⚡ Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine!
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Koa Framework
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📌 Notes

- The node_modules folder is usually not uploaded to version control, but it exists here to run the project without missing packages.
- Each file/project is independent unless otherwise specified.
